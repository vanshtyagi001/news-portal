# RULE 1: Handle SHORT Article URLs (e.g., /article/41315)
# This rule takes the ID, finds the corresponding slug, and permanently redirects to the "pretty" URL.
# This is great for SEO as it consolidates all links to one format.
RewriteRule ^article/(\d+)/?$ article-redirect.php?id=$1 [L,QSA]

# RULE 2: Handle "Pretty" News Article URLs (e.g., /news/my-post-slug)
# This is the main rule that internally rewrites the URL to the actual PHP file.

# RULE 3: Handle Category Archives (e.g., /category/technology)

# RULE 4: Handle Tag Archives (e.g., /tag/ai)
